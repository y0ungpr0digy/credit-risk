## Overview of the Analysis

In this section, describe the analysis you completed for the machine learning models used in this Challenge. This might include:

* Explain the purpose of the analysis.

**-The purpose of this analysis was to create & evaluate the accuracy of data models that predicts the credit worthiness of potential borrowers from peer-to-peer lending services


## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.


--Balanced Accuracy Score: 95.20% --> this means that when taking into account the sensitivity (recall and/or true positive rate) and specificity (true negative rate) of the model, the balanced prediction accuracy was 95.2%
Precision Score: 92% --> This means 92% of predicted positives were correct
Recall Score: 95% --> this means that the model was 95% precise in measuring true positive values our of all positive predictions made
## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. 

-I would recommend using this model to predict the creditworthiness of borrowers, because it has over 95% accuracy in predicting the outcome of the repayment of the initial loan. That accuracy range could be easily molded into a business risk profile to ensure sufficient capital flow for the lenders to remain in business/make a profit.
